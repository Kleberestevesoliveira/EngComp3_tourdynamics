# Engineering Computations

After the two foundation course modules, equipping you with the coding patterns for numerical computing, this module is our launching pad to investigate _change, motion_, and _dynamics_, using computational thinking.

## Module 3: Fly at change in systems

### [Lesson 1](http://go.gwu.edu/engcomp3lesson1): Catch things in motion

Working with images and videos in Python using `imageio`. Interactive Matplotlib figures in the notebook, and capturing mouse clicks on images for digitizing an object's position. Computing velocity and acceleration from position captures: a falling ball, and projectile motion. Computing numerical derivatives using differences. Free-fall acceleration from real data.

### [Lesson 2](http://go.gwu.edu/engcomp3lesson2): Step to the future

Computing velocity and position from accelerometer data: a roller-coaster ride. Using the `subplot()` function go draw more than one plot in the same figure. **Euler's method** for initial-value problems, and Taylor expansion showing first-order accuracy. The second-order differential model for an object in free fall written as two first-order differential equations, leading to a vector form. General design of a code to solve ordinary differential equations (ODEs). Application to free fall of a tennis ball and comparison with experimental data. Improved model accounting for air resistance.

### [Lesson 3](http://go.gwu.edu/engcomp3lesson3): Get with the oscillations

Differential model of a spring-mass system without friction: state vector and system in vector form. Amplitude growth with Euler's method on oscillatory systems, and the fix: Euler-Cromer method (semi-implicit Euler).
Numerically observed order of accuracy using a convergence plot: numerical error with different time increments, âˆ†t.
Modified Euler's method, and observed order of accuracy.

### [Lesson 4](http://go.gwu.edu/engcomp3lesson4): Bird's-eye view of mechanical vibrations

General spring-mass systems with damping and a driving force, revealing a variety of behaviors. Presents a powerful new method to study dynamical systems based on visualizing direction fields and trajectories in the phase plane.
